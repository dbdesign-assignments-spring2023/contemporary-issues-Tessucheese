# The Ethics of Big Data

_How should big data be used, what is moral, and what is so called legal? When the data is analyzed, is it absolutely objective, or do analysts decide which data they prefer to draw more idealistic conclusions? When we, ordinary Internet users, check the box to agree to obtain our data, have we ever thought about the consequences?_

## Data Deception and Reality

From my perspective, the data demonstrates deception in its truest premise. 

**For Internet companies**, like _Cambridge Analytica_, they get data for a high-sounding reason, and engage in unethical behavior of cheating. Because people cannot be defined, many things cannot be defined only with data. For example, _Cambridge Analytica aspects of the typical **"big five"** personality traits._ Are 5 characteristics enough to distinguish all voters? We all know it's not enough. The answer is still reasonable, or what the politicians expected, or an unethical outcome. 

**For users**, we also cheat on the data, I will create a more glamorous image on Instagram, which does not mean that my life is the same full of travel, feasts and fancy dresses. Most of the time I was just doing homework, staying up late and going to different places for internships. Therefore, users who provide data that is true to a certain extent are also deceiving. Many times, I choose _"I agreed the conditions, I agreed to get my data for more procise promotion."_, but I know that I have not considered whether my data will be used for inappropriate things, whether it will be selling to spam sites, will it be used for inaccurate analysis, because I just want to skip this pop-up window and do my thing. The topic of using data is more of a _philosophical_ question for me, and I prefer to trust data because the conclusions make more sense when the real thing is there. Sometimes, there may be well-intentioned deception, but a lot of data analysis has a sense of morality, and it is trying to help us understand the world, which is still beautiful.

## How should we not be deceived by data

[Cambridge Analytica, the Election Interference Operation That Wasn't](https://reason.com/2020/11/03/cambridge-analytica-the-election-interference-operation-that-wasnt/)

From my perspective, the data demonstrates deception in its truest premise.

Since the data has an **absolutely real part**, then we must be able to avoid being deceived _“confusion and self-delusion, in which media paranoia and political misunderstandings intersect”_ The meaning of data exists because we can change and manipulate them. And we want the data to be more honest, then we should be more honest. And interest supremacists are not smarter, but lose their value in the chaos. These Internet companies try to manipulate the data to get the results they want, and they also confuse themselves with databases that should be more real. When the exaggeration dissipates like a fog, people will finally see the truth.

Apart from these superficial remarks of "becoming a better self", the **law** must be a more effective and imperative tool. I remember that Apple will not ask users if they are willing to be _"track data"_ until 2021. This is what the law does, and respect for data.
